EKG:
[DATE] nsr W incomplete rbbb
IMAGING:
[DATE] CXR
FINDINGS/
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy opacity in the peripheral right lower lobe may represent atelectasis, chronic
parenchymal scarring or focal pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. No pneumothorax.
No pleural effusion.
2. Normal heart size. Atherosclerotic tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
3. No acute osseous abnormality. There is an IVC filter.
[DATE] CT ABD/PELV
Again seen is a complex pelvic mass at and slightly to the right of midline, now measuring
11.4 cm anteroposterior, 10 cm transverse, and 11.5 cm craniocaudal, previously 14.5 X 11.4
X 11.2 cm when using similar measurement technique. Although there is interval decrease in
size, this appears to represent decrease in the cystic component, as there is increasing
mural and septal nodularity and thickening compared to previous imaging. Finding is
consistent with ovarian neoplasm. Degree of mass effect on the left common iliac vein is
decreased compared to the prior study.
IMPRESSION:
1. Complex cystic and solid mass in the pelvis as detailed above, suspicious for ovarian
neoplasm. Since previous imaging, the mural/septal nodularity and wall thickening appear
increased.
2. Asymmetrically smaller left common and external iliac veins, consistent with sequela of
prior thrombus. No acute deep vein thrombus is identified.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
is a [AGE] y.o. F with a history of essential thrombocytosis, DVT, PE s/p IVC filter,
B[AGE] deficiency anemia, pelvic mass, admitted 6/30/2023 s/p exlap, R oophrecotmy, LOA,
