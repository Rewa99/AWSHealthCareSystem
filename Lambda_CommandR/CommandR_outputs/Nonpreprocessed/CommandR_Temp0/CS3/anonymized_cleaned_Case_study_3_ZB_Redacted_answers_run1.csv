"The patient is recommended to receive short-term sub-acute rehab (SAR) following their surgery, which will focus on physical therapy, likely lasting two to three days (Pages 14,15,20,22,26). Following this, if the patient does not qualify for SAR, the plan is for them to return home, with family assistance and a rolling walker. This scenario is anticipated to take around two to three days as well (Pages 14,15,20,22). The patient is also discussed in relation to a potential short-term hospital stay of ""at least one more night"" to monitor their hemoglobin levels (Page 20). 

The physical therapy plan involves stair negotiation, gait training, ADL training, balance work, and compensatory technique education, with a frequency of three to five times per week. The patient's prognosis is reported as good (Page 26). 

Additionally, the patient has a mentioned post-operative care plan involving various medications and monitoring (Pages 7,11,20,21).
