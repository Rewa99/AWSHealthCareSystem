"Based on the information provided in the PDF, the patient has a short-term care plan related to their recovery after surgery. The plan is as follows:

- Recommend sub-acute rehab (SAR) as the patient is not at baseline and was previously ambulatory with a single-point cane, but is now using a rolling walker. If the patient does not qualify for SAR, then home with family assist and home health physical therapy is recommended. The patient will need a rolling walker for home use. (Page 26)

The expected duration of this short-term care plan is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the patient's prognosis for goal completion is good. The plan indicates the patient will need continued skilled physical therapy intervention to improve impairments and limitations, maximize safety, progress functional independence, and facilitate safe discharge."
