"The patient has a short-term care plan mentioned on Pages 22-23:

- The patient will receive physical therapy 3-5 times per week to improve impairments and functional limitations, maximize safety, progress functional independence, and facilitate safe discharge.
- The physical therapist recommends sub-acute rehabilitation (SAR) placement upon discharge, as the patient is not at her baseline and was previously ambulatory with a single-point cane prior to admission. 
- If the patient does not qualify for SAR, the recommendation is for the patient to go home with family assistance and home health physical therapy, with a rolling walker.
- The expected duration of this short-term care plan is not explicitly stated, but it is likely to take several days to weeks based on the physical therapy recommendations."
