"Based on the information in the PDF, it appears the patient has a short-term care plan after their recent surgery:

- The physical therapy note on Page 22-23 indicates the patient would benefit from continued skilled physical therapy intervention to improve impairments and functional limitations, maximize safety, progress functional independence, and facilitate safe discharge. The physical therapist recommends a sub-acute rehabilitation (SAR) placement, as the patient is not at their baseline ambulatory level and was using a straight cane prior to admission.
- The discharge disposition on Page 23 also states ""Sub acute rehab (SAR pt is not at baseline as she was ambulatory with SC PTA and now using RW. if pt does not qualify then home with family assist and HHPT. will need RW for home at that time also.)""

No exact timeframe is provided, but the short-term care plan appears to be sub-acute rehabilitation, with the possibility of home health physical therapy if the patient does not qualify for SAR.
