"Based on the information provided in the PDF, there is a short-term care plan for the patient:

- The physical therapy note on Page 22 indicates the patient would benefit from continued skilled physical therapy intervention to improve impairments and limitations, maximize safety, progress functional independence, and facilitate safe discharge.
- The physical therapy plan recommends sub-acute rehab (SAR) as the patient is not at baseline and was previously ambulating with a single-point cane, but is now using a rolling walker. If the patient does not qualify for SAR, then home with family assist and home health physical therapy is recommended, with the patient needing a rolling walker for home use.
- The expected length of the short-term care plan is not explicitly stated, but the physical therapy note indicates the prognosis for goal completion is Good and the patient should require 3-5 sessions per week.
