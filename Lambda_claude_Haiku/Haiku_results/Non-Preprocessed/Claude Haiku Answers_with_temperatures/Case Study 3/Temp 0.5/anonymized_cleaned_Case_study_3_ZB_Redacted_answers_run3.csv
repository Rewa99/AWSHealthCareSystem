"Based on the information provided in the PDF, the patient has a short-term care plan related to their recovery after surgery. The plan is as follows:

- Recommend sub-acute rehab (SAR) as the patient is not at baseline and was previously ambulating with a single-point cane, but is now using a rolling walker. If the patient does not qualify for SAR, then home with family assistance and home health physical therapy is recommended. (Page 26)

The expected duration of this short-term care plan is not explicitly stated, but the progress note indicates the patient is currently POD (post-operative day) 2 after the surgery, so the short-term care plan is likely expected to take several days to weeks."
No long-term care plan mentioned. The document does not indicate the patient requires long-term care or has a long-term care plan.
